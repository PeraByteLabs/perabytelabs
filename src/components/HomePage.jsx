          The Core Skills Framework stands for Cognitive, Operational, Relational, and Emotional ‚Äî four developmental pillars that include 12 measurable, age-aligned skills:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>üß† Cognitive: Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, Creative Thinking</li>
          <li>üõ†Ô∏è Operational: Planning & Goal Setting, Concentration & Memory, Curiosity</li>
          <li>ü§ù Relational: Cooperation & Teamwork, Communication, Conflict Resolution & Negotiation</li>
          <li>üí™ Emotional: Self-Awareness & Control, Empathy & Perspective-Taking, Perseverance & Grit</li>

          <li>According to the World Economic Forum, by 2025, 50% of all employees will need reskilling ‚Äî and creativity, problem solving, and emotional intelligence top the list.</li>
          <li>Harvard‚Äôs Center on the Developing Child stresses that executive function and SEL in early years predict academic and career success better than IQ.</li>
          <li>Angela Duckworth (Grit), Carol Dweck (Growth Mindset), and other thought leaders emphasize persistence, adaptability, and lifelong curiosity as success multipliers.</li>
